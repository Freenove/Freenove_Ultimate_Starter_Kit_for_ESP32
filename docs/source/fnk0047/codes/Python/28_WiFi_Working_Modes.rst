##############################################################################

In this chapter, we'll focus on the WiFi infrastructure for ESP32-WROVER. 

ESP32-WROVER has 3 different WiFi operating modes: station mode, AP mode and AP+station mode. All WiFi programming projects must be configured with WiFi operating mode before using WiFi, otherwise WiFi cannot be used.

Station mode
----------------------------------------

When ESP32 selects Station mode, it acts as a WiFi client. It can connect to the router network and communicate with other devices on the router via WiFi connection. As shown below, the PC is connected to the router, and if ESP32 wants to communicate with the PC, it needs to be connected to the router.

Because the names and passwords of routers in various places are different, before the Code runs, users need to enter the correct routerâ€™s name and password in the box as shown in the illustration above.

After making sure the router name and password are entered correctly, compile and upload codes to ESP32-WROVER, wait for ESP32 to connect to your router and print the IP address assigned by the router to ESP32 in "Shell".

Component List & Circuit

AP mode
----------------------------------------------

When ESP32 selects AP mode, it creates a hotspot network that is separate from the Internet and waits for other WiFi devices to connect. As shown in the figure below, ESP32 is used as a hotspot. If a mobile phone or PC wants to communicate with ESP32, it must be connected to the hotspot of ESP32. Only after a connection is established with ESP32 can they communicate.

Before the Code runs, you can make any changes to the AP name and password for ESP32 in the box as shown in the illustration above. Of course, you can leave it alone by default.

Click "Run current script", open the AP function of ESP32 and print the access point information.

AP+Station mode
----------------------------------------------

In addition to AP mode and station mode, ESP32 can also use AP mode and station mode at the same time. This mode contains the functions of the previous two modes. Turn on ESP32's station mode, connect it to the router network, and it can communicate with the Internet via the router. At the same time, turn on its AP mode to create a hotspot network. Other WiFi devices can choose to connect to the router network or the hotspot network to communicate with ESP32.
