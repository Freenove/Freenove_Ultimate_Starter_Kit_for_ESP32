Chapter 74HC595 & LED Bar Graph
##############################################################################

We have used LED bar graph to make a flowing water light, in which 10 GPIO ports of ESP32 is occupied. More GPIO ports mean that more peripherals can be connected to ESP32, so GPIO resource is very precious. Can we make flowing water light with less GPIO? In this chapter, we will learn a component, 74HC595, which can achieve the target.

Project Flowing Water Light
*********************************************

Now let's learn how to use the 74HC595 IC chip to make a flowing water light using less GPIO.

74HC595
----------------------------------------

A 74HC595 chip is used to convert serial data into parallel data. A 74HC595 chip can convert the serial data of one byte into 8 bits, and send its corresponding level to each of the 8 ports correspondingly. With this characteristic, the 74HC595 chip can be used to expand the IO ports of a ESP32. At least 3 ports are required to control the 8 ports of the 74HC595 chip.

Circuit
=========================================

The circuit of this project is similar to the one in the last chapter. The only difference is that the photoresistor is replaced by the thermistor.

Code
========================================

In this project, we will make a flowing water light with a 74HC595 chip to learn about its functions.

Move the program folder "Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32/Python/Python_Codes" to disk(D) in advance with the path of "D:/Micropython_Codes".

Open "Thonny", click "This computer"  ->  "D:"  ->  "Micropython_Codes"  ->  "15.1_Flowing_Water_Light". Select "my74HC595.py", right click your mouse to select "Upload to /", wait for "my74HC595.py"to be uploaded to ESP32-WROVER and then double click "Flowing_Water_Light.py". 

Flowing_Water_Light
-------------------------------------------

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/15_74HC595_&_LED_Bar_Graph/Chapter15_10.png
    :align: center

Click"Run current script" and you will see that Bar Graph LED starts with the flowing water pattern flashing from left to right and then back from right to left. If it displays nothing, maybe the LED Bar is connected upside down, please unplug it and then re-plug it reversely.

:red:`If you have any concerns, please contact us via:` support@freenove.com

The following is the program code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Python/Python_Codes/15.1_Flowing_Water_Light/Flowing_Water_Light.py
    :language: python
    :dedent:

Import time and my74HC595 modules.

The first for loop makes LED Bar display separately from left to right while the second for loop make it display separately from right to left.
