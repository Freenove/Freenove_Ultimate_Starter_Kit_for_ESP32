Previously, we learned how to control the speed and rotational direction of a motor. In this chapter, we will learn about servos which are a rotary actuator type motor that can be controlled to rotate to specific angles.

Project Servo Sweep
*******************************************

First, we need to learn how to make a servo rotate.

Component knowledge

Servo
---------------------------------------------

Servo is a compact package which consists of a DC motor, a set of reduction gears to provide torque, a sensor and control circuit board. Most servos only have a 180-degree range of motion via their "horn". Servos can output higher torque than a simple DC motor alone and they are widely used to control motion in model cars, model airplanes, robots, etc. Servos have three wire leads which usually terminate to a male or female 3-pin plug. Two leads are for electric power: positive (2-VCC, Red wire), negative (3-GND, Brown wire), and the signal line (1-Signal, Orange wire), as represented in the Servo provided in your Kit.

    :align: center

We will use a 50Hz PWM signal with a duty cycle in a certain range to drive the Servo. The lasting time of 0.5ms-2.5ms of PWM single cycle high level corresponds to the servo angle 0 degrees - 180 degree linearly. Part of the corresponding values are as follows:

+-----------------+-------------+
| High level time | Servo angle |
+=================+=============+
| 0.5ms           | 0 degree    |
+-----------------+-------------+
| 1ms             | 45 degree   |
+-----------------+-------------+
| 1.5ms           | 0 degree    |
+-----------------+-------------+
| 2ms             | 45 degree   |
+-----------------+-------------+
| 2.5ms           | 180 degree  |
+-----------------+-------------+

When you change the servo signal value, the servo will rotate to the designated angle.

Circuit
========================================

Use caution when supplying power to the servo, it should be 5V. Make sure you do not make any errors when connecting the servo to the power supply.

Code
========================================

Move the program folder "Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32/Python/Python_Codes" to disk(D) in advance with the path of "D:/Micropython_Codes".

Open "Thonny", click "This computer"  ->  "D:"  ->  "Micropython_Codes"  ->  "18.1_Servo_Sweep". Select "myservo.py", right click your mouse to select "Upload to /", wait for "myservo.py" to be uploaded to ESP32-WROVER and then double click "Servo_Sweep.py".

Click "Run current script", the Servo will rotate from 0 degrees to 180 degrees and then reverse the direction to make it rotate from 180 degrees to 0 degrees and repeat these actions in an endless loop.

    :lines: 11-11
    :dedent:

Use two for loops. The first one controls the servo to rotate from 0 degree to 180 degrees while the other controls it to rotate back from 180 degrees to 0 degree.

    Before each use of **myServo** , please make sure myservo.py has been uploaded to "/" of ESP32, and then add the statement " **from myservo import myServo** " to the top of the python file.
    
    **myServo ():** The object that controls the servo, with the default pin Pin(15), default frequency 50Hz and default duty cycle 512.
    
    **myServoWriteDuty(duty):** The function that writes duty cycle to control the servo.
    
        **duty:** Range from 26 to 128, with 26 corresponding to the servo, s 0 degree and 128 corresponding to 180 degrees.
    
    **myServoWriteAngle(pos):** Function that writes angle value to control the servo.
    
        **pos:** Ranging from 0-180, corresponding the 0-180 degrees of the servo.
    
    **myServoWriteTime(us):** Writes time to control the servo.
    
        **us:** Range from 500-2500, with 500 corresponding to the servo, s 0 degree and 2500 corresponding to 180 degrees.
