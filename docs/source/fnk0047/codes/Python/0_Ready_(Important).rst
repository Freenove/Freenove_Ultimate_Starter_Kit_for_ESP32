    When running online, if you press the reset key of ESP32, user's code will not be executed again. If you wish to run the code automatically after resetting the code, please refer to the following :ref:`Running Offline <offline>`.

.. _offline:

Running Offline(Importance)
======================================

After ESP32 is reset, it runs the file boot.py in root directory first and then runs file main.py, and finally, it enters "Shell". Therefore, to make ESP32 execute user's programs after resetting, we need to add a guiding program in boot.py to execute user's code.

1.	Move the program folder " **Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32/Python/Python_Codes** " to disk(D) in advance with the path of " **D:/Micropython_Codes** ". Open "Thonny"。

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_LED/Chapter00_51.png
    :align: center

2.	Expand "00.1_Boot" in the "Micropython_Codes" in the directory of disk(D), and double-click boot.py, which is provided by us to enable programs in "MicroPython device" to run offline. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_LED/Chapter00_52.png
    :align: center

If you want your written programs to run offline, you need to upload boot.py we provided and all your codes to "MicroPython device" and press ESP32's reset key. Here we use programs 00.0 and 00.1 as examples. Select "boot.py", right-click to select "Upload to /".

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_LED/Chapter00_53.png
    :align: center

Similarly, upload "HelloWorld.py" to "MicroPython device".

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_LED/Chapter00_54.png
    :align: center

3.	Press the reset key and in the box of the illustration below, you can see the code is executed.

0.7 Note
*******************************************

Though there are many pins available on ESP32, some of them have been connected to peripheral equipment, so we should avoid using such pins to prevent pin conflicts. For example, when downloading programs, make sure that the pin state of Strapping Pin, when resetting, is consistent with the default level; do NOT use Flash Pin; Do NOT use Cam Pin when using Camera function.

Strapping Pin
===========================================

The state of Strapping Pin can affect the functions of ESP32 after it is reset, as shown in the table below.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_LED/Chapter00_67.png
    :align: center

If you have any difficulties or questions with this tutorial or toolkit, feel free to ask for our quick and free technical support through support@freenove.com at any time.

or check: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wrover_datasheet_en.pdf

Flash Pin
==============================================

GPIO6-11 has been used to connect the integrated SPI flash on the module, and is used when GPIO 0 is power on and at high level. Flash is related to the operation of the whole chip, so the external pin GPIO6-11 cannot be used as an experimental pin for external circuits, otherwise it may cause errors in the operation of the program.

GPIO16-17 has been used to connect the integrated PSRAM on the module. 

Because of external pull-up, MTDI pin is not suggested to be used as a touch sensor. For details, please refer to Peripheral Interface and Sensor chapter in ":ref:`ESP32_Data_Sheet <ESP32_Wrover>`".

For more relevant information, please click: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wrover_datasheet_en.pdf.

Cam Pin
=============================================

When using the cam camera of our ESP32-WROVER, please check the pins of it. Pins with underlined numbers are used by the cam camera function, if you want to use other functions besides it, please avoid using them.
