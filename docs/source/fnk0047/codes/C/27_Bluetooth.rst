In this tutorial we need to use a Bluetooth APP called Serial Bluetooth Terminal to assist in the experiment. If you've not installed it yet, please do so by clicking: https://www.appsapk.com/serial-bluetooth-terminal/ The following is its logo.

Component knowledge
======================================

ESP32's integrated Bluetooth function Bluetooth is a short-distance communication system, which can be divided into two types, namely Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) and Classic Bluetooth. There are two modes for simple data transmission: master mode and slave mode.

Master mode
-------------------------------------

In this mode, works are done in the master device and it can connect with a slave device. And we can search and select slave devices nearby to connect with. When a device initiates connection request in master mode, it requires information of the other Bluetooth devices including their address and pairing passkey. After finishing pairing, it can connect with them directly.

Slave mode
--------------------------------------

The Bluetooth module in slave mode can only accept connection request from a host computer, but cannot initiate a connection request. After connecting with a host device, it can send data to or receive from the host device.

Bluetooth devices can make data interaction with each other, as one is in master mode and the other in slave mode. When they are making data interaction, the Bluetooth device in master mode searches and selects devices nearby to connect to. When establishing connection, they can exchange data. When mobile phones exchange data with ESP32, they are usually in master mode and ESP32 in slave mode.

    :align: center

Compile and upload the code to the ESP32-WROVER, open the serial monitor, and set the baud rate to 115200. When you see the serial printing out the character string as below, it indicates that the Bluetooth of ESP32 is ready and waiting to connect with the mobile phone. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_04.png
    :align: center

Make sure that the Bluetooth of your phone has been turned on and Serial Bluetooth Terminal has been installed.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_05.png
    :align: center

Click "Search" to search Bluetooth devices nearby and select "ESP32 test" to connect to.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_06.png
    :align: center

Turn on software APP, click the left of the terminal. Select "Devices" 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_07.png
    :align: center

Select ESP32test in classic Bluetooth mode, and a successful connecting prompt will appear as shown on the right illustration.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_08.png
    :align: center

And now data can be transferred between your mobile phone and computer via ESP32-WROVER.

Send 'Hello!'' from your phone, when the computer receives it, reply "Hi" to your phone.

Compile and upload code to ESP32. The operation of the APP is the same as 27.1, you only need to change the sending content to "led_on" and "led_off" to operate LEDs on the ESP32-WROVER.

Data sent from mobile APP:

The phenomenon of LED

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_32.png
    :align: center

Attention: If the sending content isn't "led-on' or "led-off", then the state of LED will not change. If the LED is on, when receiving irrelevant content, it keeps on; Correspondingly, if the LED is off, when receiving irrelevant content, it keeps off.

The following is the program code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/C/Sketches/Sketch_27.3_BluetoothToLed/Sketch_27.3_BluetoothToLed.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c

    :dedent:

Define a buffer to receive data from Bluetooth, and use "count" to record the bytes of data received.

Reference
-------------------------------

strncmp() functions are often used for string comparisons, which are accurate and stable.

.. py:function:: int strncmp(const char *str1, const char *str2, size_t n)	
    
    str1: the first string to be compared 
    
    str2: the second string to be compared 
    
    n: the biggest string to be compared
    
    Return value: if stir1>str2, then return value>0.
    
        If return value is 0, then the contents of str1 and str2 are the same.
    
        If str1< str2, then return value<0.

|

Function memset is mainly used to clean and initialize the memory of array

.. py:function:: void *memset(void *s, int c, unsigned long n)	
    
    Function memset() is to set the content of a certain internal storage as specified value.
    
    *s: the initial address of the content to clear out. 
    
    c:to be replaced as specified value 
    
    n: the number of byte to be replaced
