In the previous section, we used web page to display the video data captured by ESP32, and in this section, we will use a mobile phone to display it.

Project Camera Tcp Server
******************************************

Connect ESP32 using USB and check its IP address through serial monitor. Use a mobile phone to obtain video and image data.

Install Freenove app
===============================

There are three ways to install app, you can choose any one. 

Method 1
---------------------------------

Use Google play to search "Freenove", download and install.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/35_Camera_Tcp_Server/Chapter35_00.png
    :align: center

Method 2
--------------------------------

Visit https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freenove.suhayl.Freenove, and click install.

Method 3
--------------------------------------

Visit https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_app_for_Android, download the files in this library, and install freenove.apk to your Android phone manually. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/35_Camera_Tcp_Server/Chapter35_02.png

Menu
-----------------------------------------------

Open application "Freenove", as shown below:

Freenove 4WD Car for Raspberry Pi
----------------------------------------------------

In this chapter, we use Freenove 4WD Car for Raspberry Pi, so it is necessary to understand the interface of this mode.

Circuit
=================================

Connect Freenove ESP32 to the computer using the USB cable.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/32_WiFi_Working_Modes/Chapter32_01.png
    :align: center

Sketch
===================================

Click Tools in the menu bar, select Partition Scheme:" :red:`Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)` ", as shown in the figure below.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/35_Camera_Tcp_Server/Chapter35_05.png
    :align: center

After making sure the Tools is configured correctly, don't run Sketch. Due to WiFi, we need to modify Sketch a little bit based on physical situation.

In the box in the figure above, ssid_Router and password_Router are the user's Router name and password, which need to be modified according to the actual name and password. ssid_AP and password_AP are name and password of a AP created by ESP32, and they are freely set by the user. When all settings are correct, compile and upload the code to ESP32, turn on the serial port monitor, and set the baud rate to 115200. The serial monitor will print out two IP addresses.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/35_Camera_Tcp_Server/Chapter35_07.png

There are two methods for you to check camera data of ESP32 via mobile phone APP.

Method 1
----------------------------------------

Using your phone's WiFi function, select the WiFi name represented by ssid_AP in Sketch and enter the password "password_AP" to connect. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/35_Camera_Tcp_Server/Chapter35_08.png

Next, open Freenove app and select 4WD Car for Raspberry Pi mode.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/35_Camera_Tcp_Server/Chapter35_09.png
    :align: center

Enter the IP address printed by serial port in the new interface, which generally is "192.168.4.1"

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/35_Camera_Tcp_Server/Chapter35_10.png
    :align: center

Click "Connect".

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/35_Camera_Tcp_Server/Chapter35_11.png
    :align: center

Method 2:
---------------------------------------

Using your phone's WiFi function, select the router named ssid_Router and enter the password "ssid_password" to connect. And then open Freenove app and select 4WD Car for Raspberry Pi mode. The operation is similar to Method 1.

Enter the IP address printed by serial port in the new interface, which generally is not "192.168.4.1" but another one. The IP address in this example is "192.168.1.100". After entering the IP address, click "Connect".

The following is the main program code. You need include other code files in the same folder when write your own code.

    :linenos:

    Serial.begin(115200);
    Serial.setDebugOutput(true);
    Serial.println();

Define a variable for camera interface and initialize it.

    :dedent:

loopTask_ Blink()function will control the blinking of LED. When you see LED blinking, it indicates that ESP32 has been configured and starts working.
