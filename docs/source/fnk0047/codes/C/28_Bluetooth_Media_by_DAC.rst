Chapter Bluetooth Media by DAC
##############################################################################

ESP32 integrates Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE). It can transmit not only simple data and orders, but also files including texts and audios. In this section, we will utilize the audio's receiving function of Bluetooth to receive music from mobile phones and play it. 

Project Playing Bluetooth Music through DAC
*****************************************************************

Use the Bluetooth audio receiving function of ESP32 to transcode the audio data from mobile phones and play the music through DAC output pin. 

The accuracy of ESP32's DAC is only eight bits, so the music would be distorted to some extent using this tutorial. In order to highlight the difference between having and not having an iis decoder, we recommend learning Chapter 29.

Component knowledge
================================================

signal conversion
---------------------------------------------

Bluetooth devices receive music data from mobile devices, which cannot play through earphones and speakers directly. To output DAC signal, Bluetooth devices need to decode these data with I2S decoding chip. The power of these audio signals is so small that it can only drives low-power music listening devices, such as earphone. Amplify the power of these DAC signals with power amplifier chip, so that it can drive relatively bigger-power music playing devices, such as speakers.

        Even if you do not have the capacitor in your kit, you can still build the circuit 
        
        without it, which won't affect the function. If the sound is too low to hear,

Compile and upload the code to the ESP32-WROVER and open the serial monitor. ESP32 takes a few seconds to initialize the program. When you see the prompt as shown in the figure below, it means that the Bluetooth function of ESP32 is ready and waiting for the connection of other Bluetooth devices.
