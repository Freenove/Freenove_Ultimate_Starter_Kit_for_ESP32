ESP32 is a micro control unit with integrated Wi-Fi launched by Espressif, which features strong properties and integrates rich peripherals. It can be designed and studied as an ordinary Single Chip Micyoco(SCM) chip, or connected to the Internet and used as an Internet of Things device.

ESP32 can be developed using the Arduino platform, which will definitely make it easier for people who have learned arduino to master. Moreover, the code of ESP32 is completely open-source, so beginners can quickly learn how to develop and design IOT smart household products including smart curtains, fans, lamps and clocks.

Generally, ESP32 projects consist of code and circuits. Don't worry even if you've never learned code and circuits, because we will gradually introduce the basic knowledge of C programming language and electronic circuits, from easy to difficult. Our products contain all the electronic components and modules needed to complete these projects. It's especially suitable for beginners.

We divide each project into four parts, namely Component List, Component Knowledge, Circuit and Code. Component List helps you to prepare material for the experiment more quickly. Component Knowledge allows you to quickly understand new electronic modules or components, while Circuit helps you understand the operating principle of the circuit. And Code allows you to easily master the use of SEP32 and accessory kit. After finishing all the projects in this tutorial, you can also use these components and modules to make products such as smart household, smart cars and robots to transform your creative ideas into prototypes and new and innovative products.

In addition, if you have any difficulties or questions with this tutorial or toolkit, feel free to ask for our quick and free technical support through support@freenove.com

ESP32-WROVER
***********************************************************************

ESP32-WROVER has launched a total of two antenna packages, PCB on-board antenna and IPEX antenna respectively. The PCB on-board antenna is an integrated antenna in the chip module itself, so it is convenient to carry and design. The IPEX antenna is a metal antenna derived from the integrated antenna of the chip module itself, which is used to enhance the signal of the module.

In ESP32, GPIO is an interface to control peripheral circuit. For beginners, it is necessary to learn the functions of each GPIO. The following is an introduction to the GPIO resources of the ESP32-WROVER development board.

In the following projects, we only use USB cable to power ESP32-WROVER by default.

In the whole tutorial, we don't use T extension to power ESP32-WROVER. So 5V and 3.3V (including EXT 3.3V) on the extension board are provided by ESP32-WROVER. 

We can also use DC jack of extension board to power ESP32-WROVER.In this way, 5v and EXT 3.3v on extension board are provided by external power resource.

    :align: center

The interface of Arduino Software is as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Preface/Preface36.png
    :align: center

Programs written with Arduino Software (IDE) are called sketches. These sketches are written in the text editor and saved with the file extension.ino. The editor has features for cutting/pasting and searching/replacing text. The message area gives feedback while saving and exporting and also displays errors. The console displays text output by the Arduino Software (IDE), including complete error messages and other information. The bottom right-hand corner of the window displays the configured board and serial port. The toolbar buttons allow you to verify and upload programs, create, open, and save sketches, and open the serial monitor.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Preface/Preface37.png
    :align: center

Additional commands are found within the five menus: File, Edit, Sketch, Tools, Help. The menus are context sensitive, which means only those items relevant to the work currently being carried out are available.

Notes for GPIO
*********************************

Strapping Pin
=================================

There are five Strapping pins for ESP32:MTDI、GPIO0、GPIO2、MTDO、GPIO5。

With the release of the chip's system reset (power-on reset, RTC watchdog reset, undervoltage reset), the strapping pins sample the level and store it in the latch as "0" or "1" ", and keep it until the chip is powered off or turned off.

Each Strapping pin is connecting to internal pull-up/pull-down.  Connecting to high-impedance external circuit or without an external connection, a strapping pin's default value of input level will be determined by internal weak pull-up/pull-down. To change the value of the Strapping, users can apply an external pull-down/pull-up resistor, or use the GPIO of the host MCU to control the level of the strapping pin when the ESP32's power on reset is released.

**When releasing the reset, the strapping pin has the same function as a normal pin.**

The followings are default configurations of these five strapping pins at power-on and their functions under the corresponding configuration.

    :align: center

Flash Pin

GPIO6-11 has been used to connect the integrated SPI flash on the module, and is used when GPIO 0 is power on and at high level. Flash is related to the operation of the whole chip, so the external pin GPIO6-11 cannot be used as an experimental pin for external circuits, otherwise it may cause errors in the operation of the program. 

In older versions, the flash pin looks like the image below.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Preface/Preface48.png
    :align: center

In the new release, we no longer introduce GPIO6-11.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Preface/Preface49.png
    :align: center

GPIO16-17 has been used to connect the integrated PSRAM on the module. 

Because of external pull-up, MTDI pin is not suggested to be used as a touch sensor. For details, please refer to Peripheral Interface and Sensor chapter in "ESP32 Data_Sheet".

For more relevant information, please check: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wrover_datasheet_en.pdf.

Cam Pin
========================================

When using the camera of our ESP32-WROVER, please check the pins of it. 

Pins with underlined numbers are used by the camera function, if you want to use other functions besides it, please avoid using them.
