##############################################################################

In this chapter, we'll focus on the WiFi infrastructure for ESP32-WROVER. 

ESP32-WROVER has 3 different WiFi operating modes: station mode, AP mode and AP+station mode. All WiFi programming projects must be configured with WiFi operating mode before using WiFi, otherwise WiFi cannot be used.

Station mode
----------------------------------------

When ESP32 selects Station mode, it acts as a WiFi client. It can connect to the router network and communicate with other devices on the router via WiFi connection. As shown below, the PC is connected to the router, and if ESP32 wants to communicate with the PC, it needs to be connected to the router.

Because the names and passwords of routers in various places are different, before the Sketch runs, users need to enter the correct router's name and password in the box as shown in the illustration above.

After making sure the router name and password are entered correctly, compile and upload codes to ESP32-WROVER, open serial monitor and set baud rate to 115200. And then it will display as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/32_WiFi_Working_Modes/Chapter32_03.png

When ESP32-WROVER successfully connects to "ssid_Router", serial monitor will print out the IP address assigned to ESP32-WROVER by the router.

Component List & Circuit
============================================

Component List & Circuit are the same as in Section 30.1.

Component knowledge
============================================

AP mode
----------------------------------------------

When ESP32 selects AP mode, it creates a hotspot network that is separate from the Internet and waits for other WiFi devices to connect. As shown in the figure below, ESP32 is used as a hotspot. If a mobile phone or PC wants to communicate with ESP32, it must be connected to the hotspot of ESP32. Only after a connection is established with ESP32 can they communicate.

Before the Sketch runs, you can make any changes to the AP name and password for ESP32 in the box as shown in the illustration above. Of course, you can leave it alone by default.

Compile and upload codes to ESP32-WROVER, open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 115200. And then it will display as follows.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/32_WiFi_Working_Modes/Chapter32_06.png
    :align: center

When observing the print information of the serial monitor, turn on the WiFi scanning function of your phone, and you can see the ssid_AP on ESP32, which is called "WiFi_Name" in this Sketch. You can enter the password "12345678" to connect it or change its AP name and password by modifying Sketch.

AP+Station mode
----------------------------------------------

In addition to AP mode and station mode, ESP32 can also use AP mode and station mode at the same time. This mode contains the functions of the previous two modes. Turn on ESP32's station mode, connect it to the router network, and it can communicate with the Internet via the router. At the same time, turn on its AP mode to create a hotspot network. Other WiFi devices can choose to connect to the router network or the hotspot network to communicate with ESP32.

Connect Freenove ESP32 to the computer using the USB cable.

It is analogous to project 32.1 and project 32.2. Before running the Sketch, you need to modify ssid_Router, password_Router, ssid_AP and password_AP shown in the box of the illustration above.

After making sure that Sketch is modified correctly, compile and upload codes to ESP32-WROVER, open serial monitor and set baud rate to 115200. And then it will display as follows:
